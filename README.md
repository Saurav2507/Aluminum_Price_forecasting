Optimizing Aluminium Procurement through Price Forecasting

To address the problem of inefficient aluminium procurement and achieve the desired business and ML success criteria, a comprehensive approach involving data analysis, predictive modeling, and strategic decision-making can be implemented. Here's a detailed plan:

Strategic Plan for Optimizing Aluminium Procurement
1. Data Collection and Preparation
Historical Data: Gather historical data on aluminium prices, procurement volumes, supplier performance, and market trends.

External Data: Collect external data such as economic indicators, industry reports, and geopolitical events that may influence aluminium prices.

Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. Predictive Modeling
Model Selection: Choose appropriate predictive models such as ARIMA, SVM, or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time series forecasting.

Feature Engineering: Identify and create relevant features that can improve the accuracy of the models (e.g., seasonality, economic indicators).

Model Training: Train the models on historical data and validate their performance using techniques like cross-validation.

Model Evaluation: Assess model accuracy using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

3. Risk Management
Risk Assessment: Use models like the Cox Proportional Hazards Model to evaluate supplier risks and market volatility.

Scenario Analysis: Conduct scenario analysis to understand the impact of different market conditions on procurement costs.

4. Cost Optimization
Procurement Planning: Develop procurement plans based on predicted price trends to minimize costs.

Supplier Negotiation: Use predictive insights to negotiate better terms with suppliers.

Inventory Management: Implement just-in-time inventory practices to reduce holding costs.

5. Implementation and Monitoring
Integration: Integrate predictive models and procurement plans into the company's procurement systems.

Continuous Monitoring: Regularly monitor model performance and procurement outcomes to ensure alignment with business objectives.

Feedback Loop: Establish a feedback loop to continuously improve models and strategies based on new data and market developments.

Business Success Criteria
Cost Reduction: Aim to reduce procurement costs by at least 25% through strategic procurement planning and cost optimization.

Revenue Increase: Target an overall revenue increase of at least 20% by reducing procurement costs and improving operational efficiency.

ML Success Criteria
Model Accuracy: Ensure predictive models achieve an accuracy of at least 90% in predicting aluminium price trends.

By implementing this strategic and data-driven approach, the company can effectively manage procurement costs, mitigate risks from market volatility, and improve overall profitability.
